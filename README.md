# Asymmetric-Self-Concept-Change
Supplementary materials for my bachelor's thesis in psychology.

In my thesis, I explore the theoretical and methodological
foundations of Brotzeller & Gollwitzer (2025) and conduct a re-implementation of
study 4 from this article.

The article is concerned with how people change their self-concept when they receive
feedback that differs from their self-perception. More precisely, the authors examine
the effects of features of the discrepant feedback, namely the direction and the size
of the discrepancy, on subsequent self-concept change.
