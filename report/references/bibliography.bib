	abstract = {Reproductions, which we define as “redoing activities” that work with the same data and aim to keep the computation as similar as possible, enable the verification of a scientific work. We seek to advance the understanding and conduct of reproductions by providing a conceptual framework and guidance to reproducers. In the first part, the epistemic function of reproductions and direct replications with regard to mistakes – and faults as a consequence – is discussed. In the second part, the logic underlying reproductions is formulated, accompanied by formal definitions of central terms. The third and final part will provide practical guidance on reporting reproductions. In short, a reproduction should involve checking the coherence of relevant instructions, performing another computation, and comparing the results for consistency. Evaluating the consistency means exploring the impact of computational choices on results before suspecting faults as a last resort. Computational choices are necessitated by obstacles such as underspecification and grounds for conflicting choices. Regarding faults, four cases are emphasized: (1) incoherent descriptions, (2) different data, (3) different source code, and (4) incorrect reporting of results. Separate from evaluating the consistency of results, reproductions can investigate their support for a claim. Finally, improper reporting practices can reduce the epistemic value of reproductions. Therefore, reproducers should also report the scope of their reproduction by detailing, among other things, which materials were consulted and to what extent any data were already preprocessed.},

	abstract = {We present the first version of the Visual Argument Structure Tool (VAST), which may be used for jointly visualizing the semantic, conceptual, empirical and reasoning relationships that constitute arguments. Its primary purpose is to promote exactness and comprehensiveness in systematic thinking. The system distinguishes between concepts and the words (“names”) that may be used to refer to them. It also distinguishes various ways in which concepts may be related to one another (causation, conceptual implication, prediction, transformation, reasoning), and all of these from beliefs as to whether something IS the case and/or OUGHT to be the case. Using these elements, the system allows for formalizations of narrative argument components at any level of vagueness vs. precision that is deemed possible and/or necessary. This latter feature may make the system particularly useful for attaining greater theoretical specificity in the humanities, and for bridging the gap between the humanities and the “harder” sciences. However, VAST may also be used outside of science, to capture argument structures in e.g., legal analyses, media reports, belief systems, and debates.},

	abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

            During everyday interactions people constantly receive feedback on their behavior, which shapes their beliefs about themselves. While classic studies in the field of social learning suggest that people have a tendency to learn better from good news (positivity bias) when they perceive little opportunities to immediately improve their own performance, we show updating is biased towards negative information when participants perceive the opportunity to adapt their performance during learning. In three consecutive experiments we applied a computational modeling approach on the subjects’ learning behavior and reveal the negativity bias was specific for learning about own compared to others’ performances and was modulated by prior beliefs about the self, i.e. stronger negativity bias in individuals lower in self-esteem. Social anxiety affected self-related negativity biases only when individuals were exposed to a judging audience thereby potentially explaining the persistence of negative self-images in socially anxious individuals which commonly surfaces in social settings. Self-related belief formation is therefore surprisingly negatively biased in situations suggesting opportunities to improve and this bias is shaped by trait differences in self-esteem and social anxiety.},

Both studies showed that relevant self‐enhancement measures were not related to the recognition stage (i.e. the perceived need to change), but were positively related to the action stage, which referred to relevant improvement behaviours. In both studies the improved behaviour was related to improved performance, suggesting that overall self‐enhancement is positively related to improved performance. Study 2 also investigated the strength of negative emotional reaction to failures, which was (negatively) related only to the perceived need to change.},

              = 1,438), we demonstrate that intentions for self-concept change (Study 1) as well as actual self-concept change (Studies 2, 3, and 4) are larger (a) for larger discrepancies between self-concept and feedback and (b) for negative compared to positive discrepancies. Exploring these effects further in Study 4, we find no evidence that the opportunity for improvement influences whether self-concept change is positively or negatively biased. In sum, the present research provides consistent evidence for a negativity bias in self-concept change, investigates a theoretical explanation, and discusses alternative explanatory approaches.},

	abstract = {This article approaches the topic of improvement from a self-evaluation perspective, namely the interplay between the self-improvement motive and social or evaluative feedback. The self-improvement motive is reﬂected in conscious desire. It is also reﬂected in preferences for continuous upward feedback trajectories, upward comparison feedback, and feedback that may be self-threatening in the present but is likely to be useful in the future. The last type of feedback preference is stronger following a resource-bolstering experience (e.g., good mood, success feedback, self-afﬁrmation). Moreover, both direct and indirect activation of the self-improvement motive facilitates recall of improvementoriented feedback. Such feedback is associated with increased satisfaction or positive affect, a pattern qualiﬁed by individual differences (e.g., self-esteem, self-theories). Finally, improvement-oriented feedback yields better performance, a pattern also qualiﬁed by individual differences (e.g., selfenhancement, self-appraisal) as well as feedback attributes (gradual versus sudden). This territorymapping review will hopefully prove useful to future theorizing and research.},
